Design Diary 

For me, this has been the toughest milestone to complete. Now that we're well into this semester, we are obviously using data structures that I have never worked with before. A trie tree is a data structure that had me very confused when trying to implement it. I could understand a trie tree conceptually but I couldn't figure out how to actually code it into our text editor. So, I created another project where I copied over the TrieNode.h and Trie.h header files and created a main. It was easier and for the best to create another project to practice and struggle with the trie tree. I managed to get the addWord function working but I could not manage the same for the search function. After struggling with the search function for a few days, I began looking at others' code and how they did it. After looking at the other code I was able to understand how to search the tree and that I needed a helper function. I finally got the functions needed for this milestone to work and then it was on to actually implementing them in the text editor.
